This introductory section provides an overview of the project’s focus, highlighting the importance of EM waves in various fields, particularly in the domains of communication, healthcare, and scientific research.

History
The history of EM waves dates back to the 19th century when scientists like James Clerk Maxwell and Heinrich Hertz laid the foundation for electromagnetic theory. Maxwell's equations unified electricity and magnetism, leading to the discovery of EM waves, while Hertz's experiments confirmed their existence. This section outlines the timeline and pivotal contributions in the field.

Theory
This section delves into the physics of EM waves, explaining Maxwell's equations and the wave equation that describes the propagation of these waves. It covers essential concepts such as the speed of light, the relationship between frequency and wavelength, and the principle of wave-particle duality, providing a theoretical basis for understanding the diverse spectrum of EM waves.

Types of EM Waves
EM waves are categorized by their wavelength and frequency, forming a spectrum that includes radio waves, microwaves, infrared, visible light, ultraviolet, X-rays, and gamma rays. Each type has unique properties and applications, from radio communication to medical imaging and beyond.

Properties
The properties of EM waves, such as reflection, refraction, diffraction, and interference, are discussed in this section. Understanding these properties is crucial for applications in optics, wireless communications, and radar technology. This section also explains polarization and its relevance in modern technologies like 3D cinema and polarized sunglasses.

Applications
EM waves have a broad range of applications in various fields. For instance, radio waves are essential for broadcasting and wireless communication, microwaves are used in cooking and radar systems, infrared waves in thermal imaging, and X-rays in medical diagnostics. This section highlights the practical uses of EM waves and their impact on daily life.

Future of EM Waves
The future of EM waves holds exciting possibilities, especially with advancements in wireless communication, medical imaging, and space exploration. This section explores potential developments such as the use of terahertz waves in data transmission and the role of EM waves in next-generation medical therapies.

1.	Cover Page & Title Page
2.	Bonafide Certificate

3.	Abstract

4.	Table of Contents
5.	List of Tables

6.	List of Figures

7.	List of Symbols, Abbreviations and Nomenclature
8.	Chapters 
9.	Appendices

10.	References

The table and figures shall be introduced in the appropriate places.

1.	PAGE DIMENSION AND BINDING SPECIFICATIONS:

The dimension of the project report should be in A4 size. The project report should be bound using flexible cover of the thick white art paper. The cover should be printed in black and the text for printing should be identically golden.

2.	PREPARATION FORMAT:

	2.1.	Cover Page & Title Page – A specimen copy of the Cover page & Title page of the project report are given in Appendix I.
2.2.	Bonafide Certificate – The Bonafide Certificate shall be in double line spacing using Font Style Times New Roman and Font Size 14, as per the format in Appendix II.
2.3.	Abstract – Abstract should be one page synopsis of the project report typed double line spacing, Font Style Times New Roman and Font Size 14.
2.4.	Table of Contents - The table of contents should list all material following it as well as any material which precedes it. The title page and bonafide certificate will not find a place among the items listed in Table of Contents but there should be the page numbers. A specimen copy of the Table of Contents of the report is given in Appendix III.
2.5.	List of Tables – The list should use exactly the same captions as they appear above the tables in the text. One and a half spacing should be adopted for typing the matter under this head.
2.6.	List of Figures – The list should use exactly the same captions as they appear below the figures in the text. One and a half spacing should be adopted for typing the matter under this head.	
2.7.	List of Symbols, Abbreviations and Nomenclature – One and a half spacing should be adopted or typing the matter under this head. Standard symbols, abbreviations etc. should be used.
2.8.	Chapters – The chapters may be broadly divided into 3 parts (i)  Introductory  chapter,  (ii) Chapters developing the main theme of the project work (iii) and Conclusion. The main text will be divided into several chapters and each chapter may be further divided into several divisions and sub-divisions. Each chapter should be given an appropriate title. Tables and figures in a chapter should be placed in the immediate vicinity of the preference where they are cited. Footnotes should be used sparingly. They should be typed single space and placed directly underneath in the very same page, which refers to the material they annotate.
